      ## About this application

      ![Extra Terrestrial Phone Home
      Service](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-et-phone2.png)

      This [Servlets](//docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnafd.html) sample
      application is modeled after a typical call center experience, but with
      more [Reese's
      Pieces](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces#ET:_The_Extra-Terrestrial).

      Stranded aliens can call a phone number and receive instructions on how
      to get out of earth safely, or call their home planet
      directly[.](//bit.ly/asogi) In this tutorial, we'll show you the
      key bits of code to make this work.

      To run this sample app yourself, [download the code and follow the
      instructions on GitHub](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-
      servlets).
